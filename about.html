            <th> <p>Elena Nikolaeva completed her bachelor in the physics and informatics and her master in the radio physics from the Tbilisi State University (TSU) in Georgia. She accepted PhD in the geophysics from the University of Potsdam. Her dissertation was primarily addressed to applying remote sensing data to the study of landslide and earthquake and then to model these natural events.  
Elena has experience to work in the different international research institutions already 17 years. She was a research associate at the laboratory of applied electrodynamics (TSU) where she was involved in the Motorola projects about influence of mobile phone on human head. Then she worked at the Seismic Monitoring Center in Tbilisi, where she was involved in the monitoring of seismograms, modelling of earthquakes and processing of optical remote sensing data. Elena was a research assistant at the Helmholtz Centre Potsdam GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Potsdam and post doc at the Institute for Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing, National Observatory of Athens in Greece. In working together with geologists and environmental scientists, Dr. Nikolaeva has improved her previous work in order to address analysis and process of different remote sensing data using various methods for the modelling of natural processes. 
She is currently developing and introducing different remote sensing application at the National Environmental Agency of Georgia, Hydrometeorological Department. In the same time, she is a reviewer of journal papers, active in the different remote sensing international online groups and builds collaborations with different international organizations for her agency.
